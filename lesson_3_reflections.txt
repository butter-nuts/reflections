Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: For a number of reasons. It allows tou to acces your work from multiple computers/locations, as well as to easuily share your work and colaborate. It also has the advantage of an offsite backup (provided you keep a local clone)

Commands:
git remote  					| Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.
git remote -v					| Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name.
git push  					| Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.   
git pull  					| Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
